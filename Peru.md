## Weather
- The weather in October is good for machu pichu and is the season for whale watching. It is however not the best time for the coast (cold / misty). In November, rains start in Machu Pichu

## Our favorite food in Peru

	- vegan ceviche with corn and sweet potato
	- vegan lomo saltado
	- churros (close to san francisco church in Lima)
	- vegan causa limena


## Huaraz
### day/night 1: 
arrival, get used to climate
### day 2: Laguna Churup hiking (no tour required), Huascaran National Park
One of the most accessible lakes and also, a recommended walk to get used to the high altitude climate. https://www.laidbacktrip.com/posts/laguna-churup-day-hike-huaraz-peru-guide 
6km, 600m difference, 3-5 hours of hiking. 3 kilometers one way, but it is all the way a steady climb uphill. There are vans to get there. 

## day 3: mountain bike tour 
in the region of Huaraz, very adventurous, organized by Julio

## day 4: Lagoon 69
One of the best-known treks for its demand and beauty: it takes about 3 hours of walking to reach the lagoon and every step is worth it.
Along with the imposing lagoon, you can also see several snow-capped mountains of the Cordillera Blanca. A unique experience!

no tour required, but tour might be cheaper, as transportantion is long.
