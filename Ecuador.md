# Ecuador

## Mindo
- trails, bird watching

## Canoa
- beach

## Puerto Lopez
- we are taking the [diving course](https://www.maresecuador.com/diving-safaris) here

Puerto Lopez is surrounded by the machalilla national park. It seems to be very safe, perfect for humpback whale watching from June to October and for diving (for instance taking a tour to isla de la plata)
- A few things to do:

## Galapagos 

### General
- 3 main islands 
- Chistophs comments: I would not stay longer than 10 above-water days on Galapagos, it got a little bit boring at the end I would say. 1 or 1.5 weeks is a good amount of time if you visit all 3 main islands imo. They are not too different so you could stay shorter and only visit 2 as well.
- Scuba diving: if you go scuba diving there you should do a course somewhere else before to already get some experience and save a lot of money. Ask for the water temperature, it can vary enormously between islands! Or just go from Santa Cruz.

### Program 
Friday: dive Mosquera + Daphne
Saturday: dive Seymour + tortuga bay (iguanas + snorkeling + swimming)
Sunday: el Garrapatero by bike
Monday: Las Grietas + taking easy
Tuesday: Santa Fé snorkeling tour

- **Snorkeling close by**:
	- **Tortuga bay** (45 min walk, ~22C) [water temp](https://www.surf-forecast.com/breaks/Tortuga-Bay-1/seatemp). Nike **hike**. Stop for checking/swimming on **Las Grietas** Bring stuff, because there is no service/structure around. One can also **kayak** there. Need to find out the best spot for snorkeling.
	
	- **El Garapatero**. East from Puerto Ayora, 40$ both ways by taxi. Peaceful, quite empty beach. Also for - **Kayaking** but no "Es recomendable no hacer snorkeling a partir de las 17h00 por la presencia de tiburones." should go early, take water and food.

Hiking Vulcan. Day tour (inkl flamingo & tintoneras, 180$)[https://www.daytoursgalapagos.com/isabela-island]. Maybe worth for the price to stay one night? Ferry ~35$/p.p.

## Varia

### Our favorite food in Ecuador

- Verde and everything with it: empanada de verde, bolon de verde, patacones. Tigrillo was ok, but Bolon is better
- Green mango with salt
- Fruits and juices: banana with passion fruit, pina with coconut
- tonga (rice, vegetables, peanut butter)
- Club beer
- Pan de almidón. Tipo um polvilho
- tortilla de Yuka
- Moro
- Ceviche Vegano
- Veggie Chaulapan

### Animals
- Tucans, tanagers, humming birds, andean cock of the rock, (and many bird names we don't know), Capybara (Mindo)
- Green Iguana, some sea birds (Canoa)
- Pelicans, Fragatas, blue footed bobby, and many birds we dont know the name, Dogs, Sea Lions, Sea Turtle, Whales, seals, eals, white tip/black tip/Galapagos/hammerhead sharks, manta rays, Galapagos turtle, dolphins, owl.
- 
### Car Rental?

- it is possible to rent a car in quito and return it in Cuenca for instance. Alternatively, returning in Guayaquil or back in quito and then flying to lima (130-250 CHF, depending on how last minute) is also possible

### Safety

It seems to be in general safer than colombia and mexico: https://www.statista.com/statistics/947781/homicide-rates-latin-america-caribbean-country/. Guayaquil and the north should be avoided, but maybe we can still check a few other places? https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ecuador-travel-advisory.html
Mindo and Puerto Lopez seemed overall safe to us.
